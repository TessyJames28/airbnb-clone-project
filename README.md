# AirBnB Clone Project
## An Overview
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.


## Project Goal
1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


## Team Roles and Responsibilities
- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic and
 solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services and facilitates
 cooperation between development and operations teams. The DevOp builds continuous integration and continuous
 delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards by
 spotting functional and non-functional defects for improvement. They evaluate an application from different
 angles—be it functionality, usability, security, or performance (hence, many types of testing).

## API Security
### Authentication
Verifies a user's identity using credentials (e.g., email and password, or third-party OAuth like Google).
This helps to prevents unauthorized access to user accounts, personal data, and prevents impersonation
 attacks.

**Implementation:**
---

- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2)
- Support JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based auth
- Optional: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)




2. Authorization
What it is:
Ensures users can only access or modify resources they own or are permitted to interact with.

Implementation:

Role-based access control (e.g., host vs guest)

Middleware checks to restrict access to endpoints

Why it's crucial:
Protects data integrity by preventing one user from editing another user’s profile, property, or bookings.

3. Rate Limiting
What it is:
Restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe.

Implementation:

Apply rate limiting middleware to sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, booking, review)

Use token bucket or sliding window algorithms

Why it's crucial:
Mitigates brute force attacks and abuse (e.g., spamming the booking or login API).

4. Input Validation & Sanitization
What it is:
Ensures incoming data is safe and well-formed.

Implementation:

Validate request bodies and query parameters

Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS

Why it's crucial:
Prevents common web vulnerabilities that could lead to data leakage, account takeover, or system compromise.

5. Secure Payments
What it is:
Protects sensitive financial information during transactions.

Implementation:

Use HTTPS for all traffic

Integrate with trusted third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)

Never store raw credit card information on your servers

Why it's crucial:
Minimizes the risk of financial fraud and ensures compliance with PCI DSS standards.

6. Data Encryption
What it is:
Protects data in transit and at rest using cryptography.

Implementation:

Enable TLS (HTTPS) for all communications

Encrypt sensitive fields in the database (e.g., personal info)

Why it's crucial:
Ensures attackers can’t read intercepted or stolen data.

7. Audit Logging
What it is:
Tracks and logs user activities and system events.

Implementation:

Record login attempts, updates, and deletions

Monitor logs for anomalies

Why it's crucial:
Enables incident response and helps detect unauthorized behavior or security breaches.

8. CORS and CSRF Protection
What it is:
Prevents cross-origin and cross-site request attacks.

Implementation:

Set proper CORS headers

Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations (for session-based apps)

Why it's crucial:
Blocks unauthorized actions from malicious websites or scripts.
